								        <p> Last week, I took part in my very first hackathon - the Bosch Agentic AI Hackathon in Berlin - and what an incredible two days it turned out to be. Not only did I have the chance to immerse myself in the rapidly evolving space of Agentic AI, but my team (composed of myself, Daniel Glatter, Karolina Kur & Andreas Spannagel) also ended up taking first place! ü•á
									We built an autonomous agent that tackles a very real industry pain point: optimizing PCBA (Printed Circuit Board Assembly) Bill of Materials (BOM) files. Think of it as an AI co-pilot for hardware procurement.</p>
								
								        <header>
                                                                        	<h2>What We Built: The PCBA BOM Agent</h2>
									</header>
								       	<p>
									Our project aimed to solve a common problem in electronics manufacturing ‚Äî how to analyze and optimize a BOM file quickly and intelligently. BOM files often contain dozens or hundreds of components, and finding cost-effective alternatives can be time-consuming and error-prone.
									We built a multi-agent system that does the heavy lifting automatically. Here's how it works:</p>

									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12">
											<ol>
												<li><b>Input Processing Agent</b>: It reads the BOM CSV file, extracts relevant fields (like MPN, description, manufacturer, quantity), and identifies which columns are usable or malformed.</li>
												<li><b>Part Analysis Agent</b>: For each component, it queries the Octopart API to fetch real-time pricing, availability, and specs. It also looks for drop-in replacements ‚Äî parts with matching specs that might offer better pricing or lead times.</li>
												<li><b>Optimization Agent</b>: This agent evaluates potential substitutes, considering criteria like cost savings, number of suppliers, and stock levels. It ranks these alternatives and flags components that could benefit from a swap.</li>
												<li><b>Report Generation Agent</b>: Finally, a dedicated agent compiles all findings into a clean, human-readable report. This includes side-by-side comparisons, summaries of cost savings, and flagged issues.</li>
											</ol>
									The full agent workflow is available here: GitHub: PCBS BOM AI Agent </p>

									</header>
								       	<p>Agentic AI goes beyond traditional automation. It's about giving systems autonomy to reason, plan, and act within a bounded goal. The system has both a brain and tools to use for action. This approach made perfect sense for our use case, where we needed to:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12">
											<ul>
												<li>Chain multiple reasoning steps across structured data</li>
  											        <li>Adapt to incomplete or ambiguous inputs</li>
    												<li>Respond to user prompts dynamically with new results</li>
											</ul>

									<header>
                                                                        	<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
									</header>
								       	<p>Reflecting on the Hackathon, I walked away with more than just a prize:</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12">
											<ul>
												<li><b>Make that first move!</b> Agentic AI was relatively to me, and I was nervous at first, knowing nobody at the event. But jumping in turned out to be the best way to learn and I was able to contribue more than I expected!</li>
  											        <li><b>Code Fast, Debug Slow</b> Rapid, vibe, coding and prototyping is exhilarating, but when the bugs hit <i>(and they will)</i>, clear thinking and good logging save the day.</li>
    												<li><b>AI as a Creative Partner</b> Agentic systems aren't just efficient, they're surprisingly imaginative. They can spot patterns and connections across tasks that humans might overlook.</li>
												<li><b>Teamwork makes the difference</b> By first understanding each other, our skillsets and expectations, we could lay a strong base for the hacking.</li>
											</ul>

									</header>
								       	<p>I‚Äôm more excited than ever about the real-world applications of Agentic AI, not just in procurement, but in domains like logistics, legal research, weather forecasting and even design. I‚Äôm already thinking about how to bring agentic workflows into future projects and (hopefully!) more hackathons.<br>

									<p>A one-dimensional idealised model of cumulus convection, based on <a href="https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/33333/1/10.1127_0941-2948_2014_0492.pdf">W√ºrsch and Craig (2014)</a>, to simulate key processes of midlatitude atmospheric convection has been developed. The model is computationally efficient, allowing for large ensemble sizes (~10‚Åµ), and captures the nonlinear and intermittent dynamics of convective systems. It employs modified shallow-water equations with three main variables (wind, height, and rain) which are seen in this figure,  and is incorporating simplified physics for cloud formation and decay through buoyancy thresholds and rain-induced downdrafts. </p>

										<h2>Statistical methods</h2>
									</header>

									<p> <b>Statistical inference</b> is used to estimate the sampling error in ensemble forecasts of various sizes, from 2 members to 100,000. 
								        Each ensemble member is treated as a finite sample drawn from an unknown underlying distribution, and the sample statistics from the ensemble (e.g. mean) are random variables that estimate true population parameters (like the expectation, Œº). 
									The uncertainty of these variable is then the spread of their respective distributions.<br>

									Since the true distribution is unknown, <b>nonparametric bootstrapping with replacement</b> is used to estimate the underlying distribution of the variables. This involves resampling with replacement from the ensemble data to generate many "bootstrapped" datasets. 
									Each resample yields a statistic (e.g., a mean), and the distribution of these bootstrap statistics approximates the uncertainty in the estimate. This is known as the bootstrap principle.<br>

									In this study:
									</p>

							
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12">
											<ol>
												<li>Bootstrapping with replacement is applied 10,000 times to a 100,000-member ensemble.</li>
												<li>The effect of ensemble size on uncertainty is examined by <b>subsampling</b> the full ensemble.</li>
												<li><b>95% confidence intervals</b> of the bootstrap distribution are constructed using the <a href="#percentile">percentile</a> method to measure uncertainty for the mean, variance and various percentiles.</li>
												<li>Confidence intervals versus ensemble size are plotted on a <b>log-log plot</b>.</li>
											</ol>

									<p>The <b>distribution of forecast variables</b> is also of interest as it can indicate how realistic the forecast model is, and gives insights to other statistics. We use the following statistics to quantify the distribution shape: </p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12">
											<ul>
												<li>Sample <b>skewness</b>: A measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of sample data around the mean.</li>
  											        <li>Sample excess <b>kurtosis</b>: A measure of the "tailedness" of the sample distribution compared to a normal distribution.</li>
    												<li><b>Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence</b>: A measure of how one probability distribution differs from a reference (in this case normal) distribution.</li>

											</ul>

										<h2>Results</h2>
									</header>

									<figure style="float: left; margin: 0 1em 1em 0; max-width: 100%;">

									</figure>

									<p> An <a href="#Ass">asymptotic</a> convergence in the limit of large ensemble size (n) was seen in the log-log plots of the 95% confidence intervals for all variables tested (mean, variance, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis and various quantiles). 
									Seen here in Figure 3 is the sampling error of the variance decreasing proportional to n<sup>-1/2</sup> after an ensemble size between 50-100 is reached. <br>
									This convergence behaviour is expected from the <a href="#CLT">Central Limit Theorem</a>, which further predicts that the magnitude of the uncertainty depends on the distribution shape, with a large uncertainty for statistics 
									that depend on rare events. This prediction was also confirmed, with the additional observation that such statistics also required larger ensemble sizes before entering the asymptotic regime.

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									</header>

									<p> This study investigated how sampling error in ensemble forecasts decreases with increasing ensemble size, using an idealised convection model to explore the convergence behavior of various statistical properties with ensemble size.
									It was found that for all statistics tested (and assumably for all those following the CLT), the sampling error will asymptotically converge with enough ensemble members, and decrease proportional to n<sup>-1/2</sup>. This allows for the
									effective estimation of how adding additional ensemble members to a probabilistic forecast will further reduce sampling error. As such, <i>forecasters will be able to be able to make better informed decisions when designing ensemble forecast models</i>. 
									</p>
									<p>This was a small introduction to our research on estimating sampling error in a probabilistic forecast. Also reported on in this paper is how to estimate sampling error if only a small ensemble is available, and invesigating the sampling error in depth for a large range of quantiles as well as for different forecast distribution shapes. </p>
									


								        <h3>Definition</h3>
									<dl>
										<dt id="probabilistic-forecast">Probabilistic forecast</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A probabilistic forecast is a prediction generated by running multiple simulations of a model (each an ensemble member) in an ensemble, each with slightly different initial conditions or model parameters, to account for uncertainty and provide a range of possible outcomes. This approach helps improve the reliability and confidence of forecasts, especially in complex systems like weather or climate.</p>
									        </dd>
										<dt id="percentile">95% confidence interval using the percentile method</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A 95% confidence interval using the percentile method is constructed by taking many resampled versions of a dataset (e.g. via bootstrapping), calculating the statistic of interest for each, and then selecting the values at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the resulting distribution. These percentiles form the lower and upper bounds of the interval, meaning there's a 95% chance the true value lies within them, based on the resampled data.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt id="Ass">Asymptotic regime</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>The asymptotic regime refers to the behavior of a statistical method or mathematical function as the sample size or some parameter approaches infinity. In this regime, approximations (like normality of the sample mean or convergence of estimators) become increasingly accurate. It‚Äôs often used to describe the long-run properties or limiting behavior of estimators and models.</p>
										</dd>
										<dt id="CLT">Central Limit Theorem</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>States that regardless of the original distribution of the population, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, provided the samples are independent and identically distributed. In addition, the standard deviation of the sample mean (standard error) decreases with sample size, scaling proportional to n<sup>-1/2</sup>.</p>
